Our book on Semantic Technologies for E-Government, co-edited by me, Vassilios Peristeras and Konstantinos Tarabanis, has finally been published by Springer Germany. It has over 30 contributing authors working on semantic technologies applied to e-government mainly as part of EU FP6 and FP7 funded projects. The book is divided into three major parts, Architectures and Process Integration, Ontologies and Interoperability, and Portals and User Interaction. It provides many interesting details on how semantic technologies can effectively solve core integration problems as well as how they can facilitate emerging e-government trends such as one-stop-shopping,  cross-border e-government, or participation of citizens.

The book is now available at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Semantic-Technologies-E-Government-Tomas-Vitvar/dp/364203506X) or [Springer](http://www.springer.com/computer/database+management+&+information+retrieval/book/978-3-642-03506-7).
