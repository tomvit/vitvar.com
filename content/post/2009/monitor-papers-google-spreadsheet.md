Google Scholar is a great service which you can use to monitor citations of (your) papers. The major problem I have with Google Scholar, though, is that it does not expose any metadata about papers and citations. I have thus created a simple solution that allows you to extract papersâ€™ titles and their citation counts and expose them as atom feed. And all what you need to do this is Google Spreadsheets.

See my [citation spreadsheet](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=tnBz-2-6z9i8o5kxSpyIq3A&hl=en#) and a related [atom feed](http://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/tnBz-2-6z9i8o5kxSpyIq3A/od4/public/basic) for more details. In case you want to have your own, just create a copy of it (File/Make a Copy), change the value for the name you want to retrieve citations for or change the Google Scholar URL as you like, and then share the sheet as Atom feed (Share/Publish as a Web Page and select the sheet and the ATOM format). After that just add the feed as a new subscription in your favorite feed reader. Note that the feed gets updated every 5 minutes.
