[Elsevier](http://www.elsevier.com/) published our work on Semantic Web Services with Lightweight Descriptions of Services in its [Advances in Computers, volume 76](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/718525/description) (co-authored by me, [Jacek Kopecky](http://jacek.cz/), Jana Viskova, [Adrian Mocan](http://adrian-mocan.com/), Mick Kerrigan and [Dieter Fensel](http://www.fensel.com/)). In order to publish in this book, authors need to receive an invitation from Elsevier and we were glad to receive such invitation in 2008. This bookâ€™s topic is about foundations and applications of Semantic Web including Social Web and Web Services.
