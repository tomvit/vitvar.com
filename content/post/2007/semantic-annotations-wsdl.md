In [November/December](http://opac.ieeecomputersociety.org/opac?year=2007&volume=11&issue=6&acronym=internet), [IEEE Internet Computing](http://www.computer.org/internet) magazine published our article on the [Semantic Annotations for WSDL and XML Schema (SAWSDL)](/docs/IEEEIC2007-KopeckyVBF.pdf). In this article we summarise the results of the W3C SAWSDL Working Group.

SAWSDL is the first step in W3C toward standardising technologies for Semantic Web services. As a standard, SAWSDL provides a common ground for the various ongoing efforts toward SWS frameworks, such as the [Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO)](http://www.wsmo.org/) and the [OWL-based Web Service Ontology (OWL-S)](http://www.daml.org/services/owl-s). SAWSDL extends the major Web service technology WSDL with pointers to semantics that are crucial for achieving automation.
