I finally refurbished my website to a new content and style. I am now using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and a template from [serialized.net](https://serialized.net/) which I very much like for its simplicity (thank you [Josh Barratt](https://serialized.net/about/)). 

There is a lot of stuff happening that I plan to share with anyone interested in performance tuning and troubleshooting mainly around large-scale integration domains covering both traditional architectures such as SOA and ESB, but also more recent ones around microservices. I also spend much time in my home sandbox and hopefully some of my ***mud pies*** could be of interest to you.
