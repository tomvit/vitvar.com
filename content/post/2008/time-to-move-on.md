It has been 3 years and 4 months I have arrived to Ireland and started working with Semantic Web Services group in DERI. I was initially hired by [Christoph Bussler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chbussler), the co-founder of DERI Galway, and since then worked with [Stefan Decker](www.stefandecker.org), [Dieter Fensel](http://www.fensel.com), and [Manfred Hauswirth](http://www.manfredhauswirth.org). I contributed to many projects and initiatives including Knowledge Web, SemanticGov, Lion, WSMO, SAWSDL, etc. Ireland will always mean a special place for me and my family as this was the place where I started the family life and where my two children Tomas and Klara were born. Ireland will be the second home for us.

With the beginning of March, I moved over to Innsbruck, Austria where I joined the group of Dieter Fensel at the Semantic Technology Institute (STI2). This is not a big change since I know almost all people here from existing and past projects in DERI. In STI2, I will lead the group on Service Web Intelligence working on lightweight semantic service models for WSDL and RESTful services as well as on techniques to crawl and integrate services on the Web. All these activities will be mainly focused around the new EU FP7 project SOA4ALL where we will develop the technology for the large-scale SOA for the Web.
