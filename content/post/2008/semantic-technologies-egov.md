Our proposal for a book entitled “Semantic Technologies for E-Government: An European Perspective” has been accepted by Springer and we are currently in a process of signing a contract. This is a co-edited book with three editors, namely Vassilios Peristeras (DERI, Galway, Ireland), Tomas Vitvar (STI Innsbruck, Austria) and Konstantinos Tarabanis (CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece).

The goal of the book is to describe the current state of research and development in e-government empowered by semantic technologies, mainly as results of EU-funded research projects. There is a number of contributing authors that include researchers and practitioners from academia and industry around Europe. In addition, we will also have an overview of related activities in the US.

Apart from being co-editors of the whole book, we also contribute to the book with overview of results from our EU FP6 SemanticGov project. In particular, we  describe an architecture for integration of cross-border e-government services based on the Semantic Web Services architecture and Public Administration ontology based on the Web Service Modelling Ontology and a conceptual model called WSMO-PA.

The book will be available in mid of 2009.
