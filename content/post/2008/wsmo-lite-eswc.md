WSMO-Lite which describes a lightweight service ontology and annotation mechanism for Web Service Description Language (WSDL), has been accepted for the European Semantic Web Conference 2008 (you can download the paper [here](http://cms-wg.sti2.org/doc/ESWC2008-VitvarKVF.pdf)).

WSMO-Lite which is currently under a review process in a CMS working group, has been co-authored by Tomas Vitvar, [Jacek Kopecky](http://www.jacek.cz/), Jana Viskova and [Dieter Fensel](http://www.fensel.com). In this paper we define the service ontology describing constructs for services’ information model (ontology) as well as functional services’ descriptions (i.e., categorisation, conditions and effects). Using the [W3C Semantic Annotations for WSDL and XML Schema (SAWSDL)](http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/sawsdl/), we define a mechanism for annotation of various WSDL components with WSMO-Lite semantic descriptions. In addition, we define the algorithm to derive behavioural service descriptions in a form of Abstract State Machines (ASM) from functional annotations (i.e. conditions and effects) of WSDL interface operations and we outline a usage of semantic annotations for a number of services’ use tasks such as service discovery, composition, selection and mediation.
